Char Framework
Because my online alias is Char Sui (Chiness BBQ pork), it's called the Char Framework.

# Purpose
Recently, I’ve come to realize something: No matter how short-lived your inspiration may be, or how small the idea, it still requires development time.
A sudden burst of inspiration usually only excites you for about a week—the simpler the idea, the faster the enthusiasm fades. Meanwhile, more complex ideas often can’t be realized through "rapid development."

I’ve encountered this issue myself. There were times when I implemented the gameplay but then lost all motivation to polish it.
Maybe "the gameplay wasn’t engaging enough," or life got in the way—there are plenty of reasons that can make you stall.

That’s why we need a framework, or a set of tools, to shorten the time it takes to package a core gameplay idea into a product.
